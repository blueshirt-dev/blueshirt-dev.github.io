## Cura
[https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software)

This is the software that is used to translate your 3D models into something that the 3D printer can print with.

This playlist provided a lof of useful knowledge to me when I began 3D printing. I initially began with [What should you print first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrvMqrgGXuE), [10 places to get free 3d printing files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wo_VBfMPA), and [The best way to orient your prints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRbSkX5IJk) videos. After those I suggest watching any video that you feel is important to you. Such as if you want to make pieces that can withstand a bit more abuse, watch the [3D print stronger parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NzDr1YAb8Q) video.

This is a guide that is written for the Simplify 3D slicing software yet provides enough help to be useful with nearly any slicer.
